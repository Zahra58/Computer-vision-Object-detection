    "# Object Detection and Tracking using YOLOv8 and IoU Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for object detection and tracking in a video using the YOLOv8 pre-trained CNN model and a simple Intersection over Union (IoU) based tracker.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8 (trained on the MS COCO dataset) to identify multiple everyday objects in video frames.\n",
    "*   **Object Tracking:** Implements a lightweight IoU tracker to maintain consistent identities for detected objects across consecutive frames.\n",
    "*   **Data Collection & Preparation:** Includes steps for video loading, frame sampling, and ground truth annotation preparation.\n",
    "*   **Evaluation:** Provides a comprehensive evaluation of the object detection model's performance using Precision, Recall, F1-score, Average Precision (AP), and mean Average Precision (mAP) against manual ground truth annotations.\n",
    "*   **Visualization:** Generates visualizations including sample video frames with detections/tracking, class frequency plots, and Precision-Recall curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Data Collection: Load and verify input video.\n",
    "2.  Object Detection & Tracking: Apply YOLOv8 and the IoU tracker to the video.\n",
    "3.  Ground Truth Preparation: Extract frames and prepare for manual annotation.\n",
    "4.  Model Evaluation: Compare YOLOv8 detections against ground truth using standard metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AP, mAP).\n",
    "5.  Visualization: Generate plots to analyze model performance and data characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a foundation for understanding and implementing basic object detection and tracking workflows using popular deep learning techniques and evaluation methods."

YOLOv8 provides an excellent balance between speed and accuracy, enabling real-time detection and easy integration with IoU-based tracking methods. Compared to alternatives like Faster R-CNN or SSD, YOLOv8 offers faster inference and simpler implementation for video-based applications."

The update method is the core of the tracker, taking new detections and returning the updated list of tracked objects with unique IDs. Video Processing Loop: It opens your video (/content/object-detection-raw.mp4). It initializes a VideoWriter to save the output video (/content/task2.mp4). It reads the video frame by frame. For each frame, it runs the YOLOv8 model to get object detections. These detections are then passed to the tracker.update() method to get tracked objects with consistent IDs. It draws the bounding boxes, class names, and unique track IDs on the frame. The modified frame is written to the output video file.

Video Loading and Check: I open the /content/task2.mp4 video using OpenCV. I include checks to ensure the file exists and can be opened successfully. Frame Sampling: If the video is valid, I get the total number of frames. We then randomly select 10 unique frame indices spread across the video's duration. Display Sampled Frames: I set up a matplotlib figure to display the images. We then loop through our selected random frame indices. For each index, I read the corresponding frame from the video. I convert the frame from BGR (OpenCV's default) to RGB format for correct display with matplotlib. Finally, I display the frame as a subplot within our figure, with the frame number as the title and removing the axes for a cleaner look. Final Touches: I add a main title to the entire figure and ensure the layout is tight so the subplots don't overlap. The video capture object is then released. Interpretation of the Output:\n",

Each bounding box should have a label indicating the detected class (e.g., \"person\", \"chair\") and a unique track ID (e.g., \"ID: 5\"). By visually inspecting these frames, we can get a sense of how well our YOLOv8 model performed in detecting objects and how consistently the simple IoU tracker maintained IDs for the same object across different frames. The output also confirms that the /content/task2.mp4 file was successfully created and contains the visual results of our object detection and tracking pipeline."

    "Define Paths: I set the paths for the raw ground truth CSV (/content/ground_truth.csv.csv) and the desired path for the standardized output CSV (/content/eval_ground_truth_std.csv). Load Raw GT Data: I load the raw manual annotation data from the specified CSV file into a pandas DataFrame (gt_raw). Normalize Bounding Box Format: Our raw annotations likely use a format like (x, y, width, height) for bounding boxes. This code converts that to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, which is commonly used and matches the format of the YOLO detections we generated. It creates a new DataFrame (gt_std) with the image name, label, and the new bounding box coordinates. Harmonize Labels (Optional but included): The code includes a step to clean up label names. In our case, it converts all labels to lowercase and fixes potential typos or variations (like changing \"microvalve\" to \"microwave\" and \"tvmonitor\" to \"tv\") to ensure consistent matching with YOLO's class names during evaluation. Save Standardized GT: The standardized ground truth data is saved to a new CSV file (/content/eval_ground_truth_std.csv). Print Summary and Head: I print a message confirming where the normalized data was saved and the number of rows in the new DataFrame. I also display the first few rows of the gt_std DataFrame.

It tells us that the normalization process finished and the standardized ground truth data was saved to the specified CSV file. The number of rows (207) indicates the total number of manually annotated objects across all the ground truth frames. The displayed DataFrame head shows the structure of the standardized data: image_name, label, x1, y1, x2, and y2. We can see that the bounding box coordinates are now in the desired (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, and the labels have been converted to lowercase. This output indicates that our manual ground truth data is now correctly formatted and ready to be used for evaluating the performance of our object detection model."

    "Next I compute per-class Precision, Recall, and F1 score for our YOLOv8 object detection results using the normalized manual ground truth data, based on an IoU threshold of 0.5. This is a core part of evaluating how well our object detection model performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what this code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Paths and Threshold: I set the paths for our YOLO detections CSV (/content/eval_detections_yolo.csv) and the standardized ground truth CSV (/content/eval_ground_truth_std.csv). I also define the IOU_THRESH as 0.5. Load Data: I load both the detections and the ground truth data into pandas DataFrames. Normalize Labels: I ensure that the labels in both DataFrames are in lowercase to facilitate accurate matching. IoU Function: A helper function iou_xyxy is defined to calculate the Intersection over Union between two bounding boxes in the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format. Evaluation Loop: I get a list of all unique object classes present in our ground truth. I initialize counters for True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) for both per-class and overall calculations. I loop through each unique class: I filter both the ground truth and detection DataFrames to only include the current class. I then group the data by image_name to compare detections and ground truth within the same frame. For each image, I perform a greedy matching process: I iterate through each ground truth box for that image. For each ground truth box, I find the detection box from the same image with the highest IoU that hasn't already been used. If the best IoU is above the IOU_THRESH, it's counted as a TP, and the detection is marked as used. If no detection matches the ground truth box above the threshold, it's a FN. Any detection boxes that were not matched to a ground truth box are counted as FPs. After processing all images for a class, I calculate the Precision, Recall, and F1 score for that class using the accumulated TP, FP, and FN counts. I also accumulate the overall TP, FP, and FN counts across all classes. Summarize and Save: I create a pandas DataFrame (sum_df) containing the evaluation metrics (TP, FP, FN, precision, recall, F1) for each class. This DataFrame is sorted by F1 score in descending order and saved to /content/task2_eval_per_class.csv. I calculate the overall micro-averaged precision, recall, and F1 score using the total TP, FP, and FN counts. These overall metrics are saved to /content/task2_eval_overall.csv. Display Results: I print a header indicating the evaluation results and display the top 15 rows of the per-class summary DataFrame and the overall metrics DataFrame. Finally, I print the paths where the results were saved. Interpretation of the Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "The output we see shows the evaluation results for our YOLOv8 object detection model against the manual ground truth:\n",
